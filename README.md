# Heaps-in-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Assignment provided by ECGR 3180 (Data Structures and Algorithms in C++)

Given: A sequence of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn input one-by-one, find the median as the numbers arrive. Median is the middle of a sorted list of numbers. For an even number of numbers, the median is the integer average  of the middle two numbers. 
See Heap lecture - 1 for an efficient O(n log n) algorithm, implemented using a min-heap and max-heap that holds the bottom half and top half of the numbers respectively.

No points for an algorithms that is not O(n log n). Hint: you need to use a heap

Heaps are implemented using the priority_queue container from the STL. 

Complete and upload the following code - 

median.cpp 

Use the following test file (do not modify) to test your code - 

median_test.cpp
